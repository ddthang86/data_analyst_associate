The final exam for data analyst associate certificate from datacamp
Certification programs often offer levels of certification that may be classified as associate or foundational, professional, and expert or master. 
These levels offer more flexibility and allow you to prove your knowledge and ability at different stages of your career. 
Last year, DataCamp launched Professional Certifications that measure the skill level typically seen after one to two years of professional data experience. 
Now, weâ€™re excited to announce the addition of Associate Certification that will allow those of you just starting out to earn your first official data certification.
The Data Analyst and Data Scientist Associate Certifications were developed in partnership with industry experts that have extensive experience hiring for data roles 
across many different industries.
